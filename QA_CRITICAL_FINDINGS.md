# QA Testing Critical Findings - Braidarr

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**QA Engineer**: Claude Code  
**Status**: CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES FOUND

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Bug #1: User Registration Endpoints Still Active
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Environment**: All environments

**Description**: 
The application requirements specify that signup functionality should be completely removed for arr ecosystem compliance. However, user registration endpoints and UI components are still fully functional.

**Evidence**:
1. **Backend**: `/packages/server/src/routes/auth.ts` - Line 13: `server.post('/register'` endpoint exists and functional
2. **Frontend**: `/packages/web/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx` - Full registration page available
3. **Frontend**: `/packages/web/src/components/RegisterForm.tsx` - Complete registration form implementation
4. **Routing**: `/packages/web/src/App.tsx` - Line 38: Registration route `/register` is active

**Security Impact**:
- Unauthorized users can create accounts bypassing intended arr ecosystem authentication
- Violates arr ecosystem security model which relies on API key authentication
- Creates potential security vulnerabilities in production deployments

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register`
2. Fill out registration form with valid data
3. Submit form
4. New user account is created successfully

**Expected Behavior**: 
Registration endpoints should return 404 or be completely removed. Registration UI should not be accessible.

**Actual Behavior**: 
Full registration functionality is available and working.

## Test Environment Setup Status

### Current Test Infrastructure
- âœ… Existing test framework: Vitest + Playwright
- âœ… API key authentication system implemented
- âœ… Backend test structure exists in `/packages/server/src/auth/`
- âœ… Frontend test setup exists with testing-library

### Required Immediate Actions
1. **CRITICAL**: Remove all registration-related code before production deployment
2. Implement comprehensive arr ecosystem integration tests
3. Add API key authentication flow validation
4. Create Sonarr/Radarr integration test suites

---

## Authentication System Analysis

### Current Implementation âœ…
- API key authentication system is properly implemented
- JWT token system for session management
- Proper middleware for API authentication
- Scoped API key permissions system

### Areas Requiring Testing
- [ ] API key creation and management flows
- [ ] API key permission scoping validation
- [ ] API key expiration handling
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection validation

---

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Address registration endpoint security issue
2. Create comprehensive test suites for arr ecosystem features
3. Implement automated security testing
4. Validate all arr-style integrations (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.)
5. Performance and load testing for arr ecosystem usage patterns
