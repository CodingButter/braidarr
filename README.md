# Braidarr

A self-hosted list aggregator for the \*Arr ecosystem that intelligently combines and deduplicates media from multiple sources.

## Overview

Braidarr is a powerful tool that connects to Plex servers and custom JSON sources to create unified, deduplicated media lists for Radarr and Sonarr. It serves as a central hub for managing your media discovery and import lists, ensuring your \*Arr applications stay synchronized with your media preferences.

## Key Features

- **Plex Integration**: PIN-based authentication with automatic library discovery
- **Custom Sources**: Support for any JSON-based media list with flexible mapping
- **Smart Deduplication**: Intelligent media matching using TMDb, TVDb, and IMDb IDs
- **\*Arr Compatible**: Native integration with Radarr v5.x and Sonarr v4.x
- **Performance Optimized**: Handle 50,000+ items with sub-5 second response times
- **Docker Ready**: Multi-architecture support (amd64/arm64) with simple deployment
- **Secure by Design**: Argon2id password hashing, JWT sessions, rate limiting

## Project Status
